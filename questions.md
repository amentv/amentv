    <summary>The Burden of Sin No 1</summary>
    <iframe Isn't this a declaration that Christ is just an apostle who will eventually submit to God?
Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all. (1 Corinthians 15:28).

Reply:  
The phrase "the Son Himself will submit to the One to whom all have been subjugated, so that God may be all in all" refers to:
 That Christ the human being will submit from Himself and not be subjected to hatred and coercion.
Christ, the man who took the form of a slave, obeys his master obediently and submissively, and this indicates the perfect harmony between the people and theology (man and God), and this harmony was not achieved in the first Adam.
Submission here is like the submission of the body to the head, as the submission of a woman to a man, as the submission of the church to Christ, and this is what the Bible declares: 
But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. (1 Corinthians 11:3). 

From here we learn that submission is submission as a divine center and order, which indicates and teaches unity and harmony in the one body.
When God the Father submits everything to Christ as the head and representative of humanity, Christ comes "as the glorified Son of man" with this consideration, handing over the king to God the Father, and submitting to Him, acknowledging that the power in Him was not human power but the power of God who is Almighty in all things. 
 It's as if to say, "Now my mission as a human being is completely over," 
I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do. (John 17:4)

Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all. (First Corinthians 15: 28)

Saying that "God may be all in all" declares that the Holy Trinity is all in all, Christ is said to be all in all (First Corinthians 15: 28) 
 The expression "God shall be all in all" refers not only to the Father but to the All-Coming Trinity: to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the One God.

That is, things return to what they were in the past according to the divine plan, and God reigns over everything and everything that He has, in this world and in the other world, not selfishly and dictatorially, but at a price, merit, and submission with love.
Worthy to take glory and dignity.  Amen. Then Amen.
