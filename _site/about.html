<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ I am brother Jafer a Muslim convert. I met the Lord Jesus through a vision He gave me in 1986.Jesus saved my life and since then He has become my Lord and Savior.</p>

<p>In 2003, the Lord opened the doors for me to proclaim the gospel on a global level through Christian satellite media. During the last eight years, the Lord has blessed me with the opportunity to be involved with Christian Arabic TV stations such as: Alhayat, ABN, Alkarma, Alhakika and Alfady. By the Grace of God, my voice has been heard around the world. Muslims are coming to Christ on live TV as the gospel is being preached. The Lord has given me a clear calling to missions; over the years.</p>

<p>He has grown a tremendous burden in my heart for Muslims. Now, the Lord Jesus is stirring up my heart and spirit to reach more Muslims 21/7 through Amen TV. Please pray that the Lord Jesus will use us to accomplish His plan in our lives according to His calling. God Bless You. Your brother and servant of the Lord, Jafer</p>
