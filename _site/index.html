<blockquote>
  <p>John 10:16 Jesus said, “I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By special calling from our Lord, Jesus Christ we have been preaching the Good News to Muslims since 1987. Many Muslims, by God’s Grace, are coming to the fold.</p>

<p>Amen TV is non-profit Christian organization founded by a convert Muslim who received this vision from the LORD.</p>

<p>The vision of Amen TV is to reach Muslims and effectively guide them to the Truth. We also strive to be the best evangelical tool and the most powerful source for reaching Muslims.</p>

<p>Many of those who serve with Amen TV are Muslim converts who have been transformed by the truth and have experienced the Love of Jesus Christ. They are all devoted to the Lord, and understand Muslims just like them. This gives them the ability to serve practically and effectively.</p>

<p>We provide evangelical programs as well as spiritual nutrition to new believers to help them grow in their faith.</p>

<p>Amen TV also helps missionaries who are called to serve among Islamic regions and for anyone who wants to know facts about Islam.</p>

<p>Pray for us and partner with us, please. We believe that you will see the miraculous work of Holy Spirit! (Those who are sharing in sowing, will be sharing in harvesting).</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
