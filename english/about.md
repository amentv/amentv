# MY PATH

Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I am brother Jafer a Christian convert. I met the Lord Jesus through a vision He gave me in 1986. Jesus saved my life, and He's my Lord and Savior.
In 2003, the Lord gave me a chance to proclaim the gospel through Christian satellite media. The Lord has blessed me with the opportunity to involve more with Christian Arabic TV stations such as Alhayat, ABN, Akarma, TruthTV, and Alfady.
My voice has been heard in many countries by the grace of God. Muslims convert to Christ on live TV as they hear the gospel. 
The Lord has grown a tremendous burden in my heart for Muslims. The Lord Jesus is stirring up my heart and spirit to reach more Muslims through Amen TV. 
Please pray that the Lord Jesus uses us to accomplish His plan in our lives according to His calling. God Bless You. 
Your brother and servant of the Lord, Jafer


# ABOUT REACHING OUT...

 Jesus said, "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd." (John 10:16)
By a calling from our Lord, Jesus Christ, we have been preaching the Good News to Muslims since 1986. By God's Grace, many Muslims are coming to Christ's family. Amen TV is a non-profit Christian organization founded by a Christian who was a former Muslim.
The vision of Amen TV is to reach out to Muslims and effectively guide them to the Truth. We also strive to make AmenTV a good evangelical tool and the most potent source for reaching out to Muslims. 
We provide evangelical and spiritual discipleship teachings to new Christians from Muslim backgrounds believers [Mbb] to help them grow in their faith in Christ.
