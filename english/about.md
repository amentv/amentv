# MY PATH

Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ I am brother Jafer a Muslim convert. I met the Lord Jesus through a vision He gave me in 1986.Jesus saved my life and since then He has become my Lord and Savior.

In 2003, the Lord opened the doors for me to proclaim the gospel on a global level through Christian satellite media. During the last eight years, the Lord has blessed me with the opportunity to be involved with Christian Arabic TV stations such as: Alhayat, ABN, Alkarma, Alhakika and Alfady. By the Grace of God, my voice has been heard around the world. Muslims are coming to Christ on live TV as the gospel is being preached. The Lord has given me a clear calling to missions; over the years.

The Lord has grown a tremendous burden in my heart for Muslims. Now, the Lord Jesus is stirring up my heart and spirit to reach more Muslims 21/7 through Amen TV. Please pray that the Lord Jesus will use us to accomplish His plan in our lives according to His calling. God Bless You. Your brother and servant of the Lord, Jafer

# ABOUT REACHING OUT...

Hallelujah! Jesus said, "I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So, there will be one flock, one shepherd" (John 10:16) By a calling from our Lord, Jesus Christ, we have been preaching the Good News to Muslims since 1986. By God's Grace, many Muslims are coming to Christ's family. Amen TV is a non-profit Christian organization founded by a Christian who was a former Muslim who received this vision from the LORD. The vision of Amen TV is to reach out to Muslims and effectively guide them to the Truth. We also strive to be the best evangelical tool and the most potent source for reaching out to Muslims.
