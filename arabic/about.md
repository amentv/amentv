# منْ نحن

اخوتي وأخواتي الأعزاء في المسيح. 
أنا الأخ جعفر مسلم سابق.
التقيت وآمنت بالرب يسوع من خلال رؤية أعطاني إياها في عام ١٩٨٦.
لقد أنقذ يسوع حياتي ومنذ ذلك الحين هو ربي ومخلصي.
منذ عام ٢٠٠٣، فتح الرب لي الأبواب لإعلان الإنجيل من خلال وسائل الإعلام الفضائية المسيحية.
خلال السنوات الماضية إلى هذا اليوم، باركني الرب بفرصة مشاركة الحق مع أحبائنا المسلمين على المحطات التلفزيونية المسيحية: قناة الحياة، الآرامية، الكرمة، الحقيقة، الفادي، وقناة آمين.
بفضل الرب يسوع المسيح، سمع صوتي في أنحاء كثيرة من العالم.
المسلمون يأتون إلى المسيح على الهواء مباشرة على التلفزيون بينما يقدم الإنجيل لهم.
أعطاني الرب دعوة واضحة للإرسالية على مر السنين.
لقد زاد الرب في قلبي العزيمة لمساعدة المسلمين للتعرف على السيد المسيح..
الآن، يثير الرب يسوع قلبي وروحي للوصول إلى المزيد من المسلمين من خلال قناة آمين Amen TV.
يرجى الصلاة أن يستخدمنا الرب يسوع لتحقيق خطته في حياتنا وفقًا لدعوته.
ربنا يحميكم. اخوكم خادم الرب / جعفر



# كرازة وتواصل مع المسلمين

قال يسوع، "وَلِي خِرَافٌ أُخَرُ لَيْسَتْ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْحَظِيرَةِ يَنْبَغِي أَنْ آتِيَ بِتِلْكَ أَيْضاً فَتَسْمَعُ صَوْتِي وَتَكُونُ رَعِيَّةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ وَرَاعٍ وَاحِدٌ" (يوحنا ١٠: ١٦)
بدعوة من ربنا يسوع المسيح، نكرز بالبشارة السارة للمسلمين منذ عام ١٩٨٦. وبفضل الرب يأتي العديد من المسلمين إلى عائلة المسيح.

Question Five: Infallibility of The Bible 
Introduction 
Is the Bible or the Quran distorted?
 Important Note: No verse in the Quran speaks of distortion of the Bible, the word of God. Rather these verses from the Quran speak of distorting the Quran, the expression of Allah. 
 For understanding: 
The main reason Muslims accuse the Bible of being distorted is their belief that Jesus proclaimed a prophet named would come after Him named 'Ahmed' referring to Muhammad. 
6 And behold, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am a messenger of God to you, confirming what is between my hands from the Torah and proclaiming the glad news of a messenger who comes after me, Ahmad." But when He came to them with apparent proofs, they said, "This is obvious sorcery." (Quran 61: 6) 

 For understanding: 
Jesus did proclaim that He would send someone after Him, the Holy Spirit (His Spirit, who has the exact nature of Christ). Jesus clarified that He is The First and the Last, Alpha and Omega, and the Beginning and the End. Jesus did not speak about a human prophet who would come after Him. 
Jesus said: "Then many false prophets will arise and deceive many (Gospel of Mathew 24: 11) and;
7 Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen. 
8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty." (Bible, Revelation 1: 7- 8, 17 – 18) 
17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, "Do not be afraid; 
I am the First and the Last. 
18 I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold; I am alive forever. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and Death. 

 For understanding: There are no prophecies of Muhammad from any prophets of God who came before him mentioned in the Bible or the Quran that spoke of him.

6 Questions and Answers - Infallibility of the Bible
Q. Why do Muslims claim the Bible/word of God has been distorted?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________
Q. What did Jesus say about Himself regarding the prophecy?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________








 There are four Muslim accusations about the distortion of the Bible.

 Accusation 1 
75 Do you [Muslims] hope that they will trust you? While a party of them, after hearing the word of Allah, a party of them distorts it knowingly after they comprehend it. (Quran 2: 75) 

 For understanding: According to this verse, some Jews at the time of Muhammad change the words of Allah after hearing and understanding them. It means they refused to apply it to their lives. 

6 Questions and Answers - Infallibility of the Bible
Q. How would you respond to accusation 1?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________________________






 Accusation 2 
78 And indeed, there is a party of them who twist their tongues to mimic the Book of Quran, that you may think it is a part of the Book, but it is not part of the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," but it is not from Allah. And they speak the lie against Allah, and they know [it]. (Quran 3: 78) 
46 Among the Jews are those who distort the words from their [proper] meanings and say, "We have heard but disobeyed"; and "*Hear you [Muhammad] may not hear" and *wrong one," with a twist of their tongues and ridiculing the religion [of Islam]. 
And if only they had said, "We hear and obey" and "listen and look at us," it would have been better for them and more correct. But Allah has cursed them for their infidelity, so they would not believe, except for a few. (Quran 4: 46) 

 For more understanding: 
The previous verse claims that after hearing and comprehending the verses of the Quran, certain Jews distorted the words of the Quran with a twist of their tongues to slander the religion of Islam. Therefore, these verses refer to the distortion of the Quran, not the Bible.

       ______________________________________________________________________________________
       ______________________________________________________________________________________

 Accusation 3
13 Then, because they broke their Covenant, Allah cursed them and hardened their hearts. They divert the words from their [proper] meanings and forget a good portion of what they got reminded of it.
And still, you [Muhammad] discover deception among them, except for a few. But pardon them and forbear [the misbehavior]. Indeed, God loves those who show moral goodness.
41 O Messenger [Muhammad], do not grieve those who are active in infidelity, of those who say, "We believed" with their mouths, but their hearts have no faith, and from among the Jews - hearers of lies, hearers even to others who have not come to you. 

They say, "If you have given this [teaching in our scriptures], so accept it; but if you not given it, beware. 
And whoever Allah wants to lead into sedition, you will never possess a thing for him against Allah. Those whose hearts Allah did not wish to purify. For them, this earthly Life is a disgrace, and for them, in the Hereafter, a more prominent torment. (Quran 5: 13, 41) 
 For understanding these verses: 
‘They diverted the words (no mention of the word of God) from their meanings’ because they forgot and broke their covenant with God. 
These verses do not speak about the Bible but talk about the Quran because Allah criticizes certain Jews for diverting the words of the Quran from their proper meanings because they say we believed in Allah through their mouth, still, their hearts have no faith and are hearers of lies. Therefore, distortion refers to the Quran, not the Bible.
The content of verse 41 indicates: They change the speech position to alter the words' [proper] meanings [taking them out of context].

6 Questions and Answers 
Q. How would you respond to accusation 3?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________

















 Accusation 4
79 Therefore, woe to those who write The Book with their own hands, then they say: "This is from [God]," to exchange it with a bit of amount.
How terrible would be them for what their hands had written, and horrible to them for what they gain. (Quran 2: 79) 

 For understanding: 
This act took place during the time of Muhammad, not before, because the writing activity is in the present tense. Therefore, this had nothing to do with the Bible. The Bible had been written and taken to many countries hundreds of years earlier worldwide. 

6 Questions and Answers - Infallibility of the Bible
Q. How would you respond to accusation 4?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________







 To Respond: We have three questions to ask:

1- Had the Bible been corrupted before Islam’s rise in history?

 For understanding: 
The Bible was written and used in Arabia during Muhammad’s life and Allah commanded Muhammad to use it as a reference. Because it has the proper guidance for the pious, it is not logical to refer anyone to a corrupted text. 
94 If indeed you [Muhammad] are in doubt of what We revealed unto you, then ask those who read the Book [Holy Scriptures] before you; indeed, the fact had come to you from your Lord, so never be one of the skeptics. (Quran 10: 94) 

6 Questions and Answers - Infallibility of the Bible
Q. How would you respond to this objection and defend the Infallibility of the Bible before the rise of Islam?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________
       ______________________________________________________________________________________
       ______________________________________________________________________________________




2- Was the Bible corrupted during Muhammad's time?

2 That *Book, which no doubt therein, has the proper guidance to the virtuous. (Quran 2: 2) 
23 And indeed God revealed to Moses *the Book: so [Muhammad] be not in doubt of facing its message, and God set it [the Book - the Torah] guidance to the Children of Israel. (Quran 32: 23)
154 Then God gave Moses the Book, to complete [Our blessings] upon who does well and a precise explanation of all things - and guidance and mercy that perhaps in the meeting before their Lord would believe. 
68 Say, [O Muhammad], "O People of the Book [Holy Scriptures], you have nothing of the truth unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has descended to you from your lord…." (Quran 5: 68) 

 For understanding: *That Book, or the Book, in the previous verses refers to the Bible [Holy Scriptures], not to the Quran, because these verses point to the Book sent down before or after the Quran.

         _____________________________________________________________________________________


3 - Could the Bible have been corrupted after Muhammad's Time? 

 For understanding: 
The Quran confirms that the Bible is the Reminder (Al thicker), and there is a promise to keep it from distortion and that it will remain forever, as we see in this verse. 
9 God has sent down the Holy Scriptures, and God shall surely guard it. (Quran 15: 9)

Q. How would you respond to this objection and defend the Infallibility of the Bible after Muhammad's Time? 
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________










 Al-thicker is the Bible (Torah) given to Moses and Aaron. 

7 And We have not sent before you [Muhammad], but men to whom We give inspiration, so ask the people of the Holy Scriptures if you do not know.
48 Indeed, God had given Moses and Aaron al-Furqan [the Criterion] and a Light and Al-thicker [a reminder] for those who have reverence for God.
105 And indeed God has written in the Book of Psalms, after [God had written] in the Torah, "that my righteous worshipers shall become heir to the Land." (Quran 21: 7, 48, 105) 

55 And your Lord knows most of all that is in the heavens and earth. And indeed, God favored some prophets over others and gave David the Book of Psalms. (Quran 17: 55) 

1 Saad: [Allah takes an oath] by the Quran that contains some [teachings] of the Reminder [the Bible]. (Quran 38: 1)
7 And We have not sent before you [Muhammad], but men to whom We give inspiration, so ask the people of the Holy Scriptures if you do not know. (Quran 21: 7)

Q. What is the name given to the Bible in the Quran?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________
Q. Why does this name of the Bible not indicate the Quran?
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________
Q. Why is this Bible’s name essential to give a solid response to Muslims toward the Infallibility of the Bible? 
A.	___________________________________________________________________________________












 The children of Israel have the Book, i.e., the Holy Scriptures.
16 And indeed God did give the Children of Israel the Book, the command of Law, and the Prophet-hood, and We sustained them with delightful things and favored them over the nations. (Quran 45: 16)
27 And God grant to him Isaac and Jacob, and We assigned to his offspring prophethood and the Holy Scriptures, and We gave him his wages in this earthly Life, and indeed he is in the Hereafter among the righteous ones. (Quran 29: 27)
27 Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting Life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him." (Bible, John 6:27)

 For understanding: The succession of prophethood God assigned to the progeny of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. Ishmael is not from the Children of Israel; he has nothing to do with the prophethood mantle, even though he was Abraham’s firstborn. 
In contrast, Allah asked Muhammad and Muslims to check the Bible as a reference. As we see in the following verse; 
94 If indeed you [Muhammad] are in doubt of what We revealed unto you, then ask those who read the Book [Holy Scriptures] before you; indeed, the fact had come to you from your Lord, so never be one of the skeptics. (Quran 10: 94) 
 In Conclusion: There is not even one verse in the Quran that shows any distortion in the New and Old Testaments as written scripture. 
The Quran makes Accusations of distortion, but not about the Bible. It instead refers to misunderstandings and misapplications of the Quran. We know this because the accusations had happened during the time of Muhammad and were written in the present tense.

 The Word of God cannot be changed or tampered with, as the Quran states in these verses.

64 For them are the positive news in the earthly life and the Hereafter. There is no alteration to the words of God. That is indeed an outstanding achievement. (Quran 10: 64) 
34 And many messengers are accused undoubtedly of lying [concerning their message] before you. Still, as they got accused of lying, they were inflicted with pain until Our victory [help] reached them. Nothing /no one can alter the words of God. And there have indeed arrived you some news about the [former] messengers. (Quran 6: 34) 

77 This was our way with those We sent before you from Our messengers, and you will not find any change in our methods. (Quran 17: 77)
27 And recite what has revealed to you of the Book of your Lord: no one can change His Words, and you will never find a refuge other than Him. (Quran 18: 27) 

Jesus said: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means move away." (Mathew 24: 35)

 Muhammad and the Muslims believed and must believe in the Bible:
136 O you who believe Allah, Allah and His Messenger [Muhammad], and in the Book of Quran. He sent down unto His Messenger and the Book of the Scriptures that God sent down from before. And whoever denies God, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone astray. (Quran 4: 136) 

84 Say, [O Muhammad], "We believed God and in what sent down to us and what sent to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes [of Israel], and in what Moses, Jesus has given, and the prophets from their Lord. We do not differentiate between one and another among them, and to Him [God], we are submitting." (Quran 3: 84) 

46 And argue not with the People of the Book, except in best manner, except with those sinful among them. And say, "We believed in what got sent to us and had been sent to you. And our god [Allah] and your God are the same, and we submit to him. (Quran 29:46)

 Many Verses in the Quran prove the Bible's Infallibility at the time of Muhammad. And should motivate Jews and Christians to stick with the Bible because the Quran describes it as a sound judgment, a Light, and a detailed Guide. It is the foundation upon which prophets must judge and rule among people. Otherwise, he would call them: 

A- Would be called: Unbelievers 
43 And [O Muhammad] how is it that they ask you to judge [between them], while they have the Torah - therein are the discernment Laws of God? Then, in spite, they turn away, but those are not [true] believers. (Quran 5: 43- 45, 47, 48) 
B- Would be called: Infidels. 
44 Indeed We [God] who sent down the Torah, therein guidance and Light. The prophets who had submitted [to God] judged according to it for the Jews, as did the Jewish teachers and scribes in which they entrusted to guard the Book [Holy Scriptures] of God, … and do not exchange My verses for a miserable gain. And whoever fails to judge by what God has sent down [in the Torah] is the infidels.

C- Would be called: Unjust. 
45 And God ordained for them that: "a life for life, an eye for an eye, a nose for nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and wounds legal justice." But whoever performs [with his right as] charity, it would be an atonement for himself. And whoever fails to judge by what Allah has sent down - those are sinful.
D- Would be called: Rebellious. 
47 And the people of the Gospel must judge by what God had sent therein. And whoever fails to judge by what God has sent down - those are defiant.

 Allah commanded Muhammad to protect the Bible. 

48 And We sent down to you [O Muhammad], the Book [Quran] with the fact, confirming and guardian over what came of the Book [Holy Scriptures].
Judge between them by what Allah sent down, and do not follow their vain desires concerning what has come to you of the reality.
We have made a rule of Law and precise method for each [nation] among you.
And had God willed, He would have made you one nation, but to try you in what He has given you; so, hasten sincerely in doing goodness. To God's return of you entirely, He [God] will inform you of the matters in which you used to disagree.

 the word; ' Mohymenan Alieh,' 
This word means guarding it against corruption.
